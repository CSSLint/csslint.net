<h2 id="contribute">Contribute</h2>
<p>Many people have expressed an interest in contributing to the CSS Lint project. We were waiting to have a solid plugable architecture and API before taking contributions. The exciting news is that we are now ready! There are several ways you can contribute:</p>
<ol class="enumlist">
    <li>If you are comfortable with CSS, <a href="https://github.com/stubbornella/csslint/issues">submit rule ideas</a>. You must provide the rule name, a human readable explanation, browsers affected, and a test case.</li>
    <li>If you are comfortable in JavaScript, <a href="https://github.com/stubbornella/csslint">fork the github project</a>, code up a rule, and submit a pull request. You'll need to provide all the same documentation requsted in item 1.</li>
    <li>If you are comfortable with Node or Rhino, <a href="https://github.com/stubbornella/csslint/tree/master/src/cli">test out the command line version</a>, submit feature requests.</li>
</ol>
