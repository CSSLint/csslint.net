<h2>About</h2>
<div class="unit size1of2">
    <p class="summary">CSS Lint is a tool to help point out problems with your CSS code. It does basic syntax checking as well as applying a set of rules to the code that look for problematic patterns or signs of inefficiency. The rules are all pluggable, so you can easily write your own or omit ones you don't want.</p>
    <p class="summary">Many people encouraged me to build this tool. Deepest thank you to Chris Klaiber, Gonzalo Cordero, Douglas Crockford and JSLint, Rebecca Murphy, the guys at GitHub, and everyone at JSConf.</p>
